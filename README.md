# Emulators

There are 2 notebooks, one for comparing emulators (ToyModel_emulator.ipynb) and one for calibration with comparisons (ToyModel_calib.ipynb).

ToyModel_emulator compares Surmise, Smooth and Sci-kit learn emulators 

ToyModel_calib uses Surmise and Smooth emulators and uses bilby for sampling.
